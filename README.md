# Emojify: Create Your Own Emoji with Deep Learning

This repository documents our final-year B.E. project at Dr. D. Y. Patil School of Engineering, Pune. Our project focuses on **real-time human emotion detection** using deep learning and maps facial expressions to **emojis** for intuitive feedback.

âœ¨ **Project Highlights**
- Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the **FER2013 dataset** to classify facial expressions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
- Developed a prototype that captures real-time webcam video, detects faces, classifies their emotions, and maps them to emojis.
- Explored the applications of emojis in digital communication, marketing, and sentiment analysis.
- Our research was accepted by the **International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research (IJSER)**.
